Projects done as homework assignments during my time in Telerik Academy's Alpha QA Track.
Tasks were completed at different stages of the program, so quality is not consistent with current abilities.

Final Project is a collaboration between three students of the academy as a graduation project over the course of the last weeks in the program.
